This web service has two methods: GetVirusWarings and GetRecordsetVirusWarnings.<br>GetVirusWarings will return an encoded XML string of news articles about various viruses with links to find out more.<br>The GetRecordsetVirusWarnings method returns the same data by using a ByRef ADO recordset instead of an XML string.

The Shakespeare Web Service takes a phrase from one of the plays of   William Shakespeare and returns the associated speech, speaker, and   play. The GetSpeech method requires a string formatted phrase from   one of Shakespeare's plays as input. The speech, speaker, and play   will be returned as an XML string. An example request is &quot;To be, or   not to be&quot;.

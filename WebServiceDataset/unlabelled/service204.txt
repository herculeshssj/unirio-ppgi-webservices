Using these services, web site owners and developers can now create   applications capable of interacting with Amazon.com?s catalog, search   engine, shopping cart and merchandising tools to provide more robust   offerings on third party web sites. Instead of simply linking to our   various products, they can embed search results, top sellers,   customized lists, recommendations, and even the Amazon.com shopping   cart within their applications.

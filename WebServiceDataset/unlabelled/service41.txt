URL jr.

This web service accepts a Big URL and converts it to an URL jr.    The website also has a web-based frontend for the web service.  Any   URL can now be converted into a very small URL (generally less than   25 characters total) that acts as a proxy or alias to the Big URL.    When a user enters the URL jr. he/she is automatically redirected   back to the Big URL.  This makes it much more convenient to post   reference links, etc. to emails and newgroups.  See our site for   examples and more detailed features.  If you do much newsgroup   surfing or tech support you'll really appreciate this service.    Also, there are some advanced URL redirection capabilities that you   can do with URL jr.  Visit http://urljr.com for more information.

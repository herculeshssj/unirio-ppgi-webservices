Web Service of the Day
http://www.webserviceoftheday.com/ws/soap/wsotd.asmx?wsdl
From the service publisher:    Web Services are cool - but some are more cool than others... every   day, I feature a Web Service that I think is a bit out of the   ordinary, and encourage you to go and take a look at it.    This web service allows SOAP clients to retrieve data from the Web   Service of the Day site. For the web version of the site, go to   http://www.webserviceoftheday.com

Web Service Ideas Bin
http://www.soapengine.com/lucin/salcentral/cidea.asmx?wsdl
As a developer/analyst this ideas bin can be used as a resource for   entering new ideas and reviewing existing ideas as sources for   developing your own web services.    The ideas bin is a free resource for analysts to leave ideas for   others to develop. It admittedly seems a little one sided (towards   the developer) but the thought is that for the web services industry   to progress it needs to start to develop larger projects which are   more complex. This ideas bin hopes to give analysts the opportunity   to be involved in the web services movement as well as full time   developers.

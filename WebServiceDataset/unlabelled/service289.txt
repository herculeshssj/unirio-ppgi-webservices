Captain Haddocks Curser
http://www2.tankebolaget.com:8080/scripts/Haddock.exe/wsdl/IHaddock
The Captain Haddock curser has one interface, IHaddock, with two   methods, GetCurseLanguages and Curse.  GetCurseLanguages returns an array of language codes representing   the languages that Captain Haddock currently curses in (send me a   curse file in your language and I'll add it!), for instance 'us'.  Curse takes a language code (as described above) and returns a   random curse in that language

Session Broker Service
http://webservices.matlus.com/scripts/sessionservice.dll/wsdl/IMsSessionBrokerService
Session state store    This Service is built using Delphi 6 Enterprise. It is Session service that one would use from a Web application such as ISAPI/CGI/ASP etc. The service allows you to create new sessions (each time their own time out period) and then add name/value pairs for the session and later retrieve these name/value pairs by supplying the Sesion ID that was returned at the time of creating a new sesion.    Each Session you create can potentially have different time out periods thus allowing for multiple applications to use the service and/or different sessions (for  differnt user levels say)in one application to have different time out periods.    Each time a session is used (such as to retrieve a value), the time for that session is reset automatically.

Air Fare Quote Search
http://wavendon.dsdata.co.uk:8080/axis/services/SBGGetAirFareQuote?wsdl
This service searches the major airlines in real time to find the   best available prices from each and returns the results, sorted by   price.     This is different from the majority of air fare search engines on the   Internet because this one finds real time quotes direct from the   airlines' web sites and not from a database that is very often out of   date.

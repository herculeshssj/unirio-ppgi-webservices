Eliza - Hi there! Are you surprised? Do you believe that dreams have   something to do with your problems?    Chat with a webservice!    The original Eliza program was written by Joseph   Weizenbaum and described in the Communications   of the ACM in 1967!!!  Eliza &quot;is&quot; a mock Rogerian   psychotherapist.  It prompts for user input,   and uses a special transformation algorithm  to change user input into a follow-up question.

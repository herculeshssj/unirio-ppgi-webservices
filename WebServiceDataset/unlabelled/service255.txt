Google Search API
http://api.google.com/GoogleSearch.wsdl
With the Google Web APIs service, software developers can query more   than 2 billion web documents directly from their own computer   programs. Google uses the SOAP and WSDL standards so a developer can   program in his or her favorite environment - such as Java, Perl, or   Visual Studio .NET.

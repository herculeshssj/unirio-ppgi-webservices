Dr.Bob's Programming Clinic Headlines
http://www.ebob42.com/cgi-bin/DrBobsClinic.exe/wsdl/IHeadline
News headlines on six topics.  Dr.Bob's Clinic News Headline Service produces headlines, with the focus on six topics: Delphi, C++Builder, JBuilder, Kylix, SOAP and BorCon. News headlines can be obtained in three formats: plain ASCII, HTML and WML (for your WAP device).  You can download a sample Windows GUI (including Delphi 6 source code) that even (optionally) translates the ASCII text from English to German, French, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish.

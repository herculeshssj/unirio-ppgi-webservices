Orbitarium

Orbitarium provides the heliocentric and geocentric positions of the  Solar System bodies for any past or future date. You can input the  time milliseconds, as Julian date, or as conventional date string. The  response messages give the longitude and latitude in degrees, as well  as the distance in AU (in the case of the planets) or equatorial radii  (in the case of the Moon). The service has a REST interface as well,  and the identical XML can be obtained by using query string parameters  over HTTP GET. The back-end calculations are performed using the  Planetizer Java library which solves Kepler's equation with  perturbations. The server-side SOAP parsing is accomplished using the  Jamsterdam SPAX libraries.

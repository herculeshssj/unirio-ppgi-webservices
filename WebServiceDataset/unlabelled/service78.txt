BAX Global Tracking Service
http://www.baxglobal.com/xmltracking/xmltracking.asmx?wsdl
The tracking web service provides the same functionality that our   Shipment Tracking page provides. If you have a MyBAX account, you   can optionally pass in your account number and password to retrieve   information that is available only in the MyBAX Shipment Tracking   page. The tracking web service is available in both http and https   protocols. You can use either one depending on your needs.

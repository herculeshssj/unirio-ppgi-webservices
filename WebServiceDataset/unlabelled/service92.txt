VeriSign Payflow Pro Payment Service simplifies e-commerce by   providing secure payment capabilities over the Internet between   online customers, merchants, buyers, sellers, and the financial   networks that move money between them. You can use Payflow Pro to   process credit cards, purchase cards, debit cards, and electronic   checks.     webMethods makes it easy to use VeriSign's Payflow Pro service by   exposing payment service APIs as Web services. When a SOAP client   calls the Web service, it invokes the Payflow services using the   proprietary Payflow Pro Java/XML libraries.     You can invoke the test service &quot;Credit_Approval&quot; that connects using   a Verisign test account. Or, you can download the package and apply   for your own account online. Through a special arrangement,   VeriSign's signup fee for Payflow Pro is waived for webMethods users.

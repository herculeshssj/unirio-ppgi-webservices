XML-based rules engine  The Xml Rule Engine allows developers to separate Business Logic from Application Code.   It reduces cost by allowing you to leverage existing code easier. Instead of changing the codebase, the same code can be reused simply changing the Xml based rule file.  Xre Online is the web service version of the engine... it allows you access to the latest build version, so you can use it to test new code, or as a free trial version.

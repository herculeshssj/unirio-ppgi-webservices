Secure Hash Algorithm-1, or SHA1 is used to generate a condensed   representation of a message called a message digest. Developed by   NIST, along with the NSA, SHA1 is used by both the transmitter and   intended receiver of a message in computing and verifying a digital   signature.  This sample Web service can be used to get the SHA1 hash in hex   format for any given string.

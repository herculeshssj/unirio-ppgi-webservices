SecureXML
http://www.securexml.net/securexml/securexml.wsdl
This service allows you to verify if an XML containing one or more   W3C compliant XML digital signatures are valid or not.    Currently the web service doesn't support HMAC (not very useful) and   Certificate retrieval methods(we don't where your certificates are).

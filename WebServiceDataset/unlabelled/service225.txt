This WebService is a small part in a bigger system aimed at providing   local and long distance call rating over the Web. Simply provide area   code and switch (3 first digits after the area code) and we will tell   you originating/destinating city, state, zip, county and also the   distance in miles between the two locations. Please test the   WebService online by using our proxy at   http://www.xeeinc.com/RateInformation/RateinfoProxy.aspx or visit to   http://www.xeeinc.com for other telecommunication related WebServices.

WhoIs Your Daddy is a programmable XML Web Service that allows you to   lookup name and domain information for virtually every Internet site.   DOTS WhoIs is a powerful web service that allows you to find all the   available information about an IP address, hostname, or domain,   including country, state or province, city, name of the network   provider, administrator and technical support contact information.    Unlike standard WhoIs web services, WhoIs Your Daddy returns XML   formatted information for hostname, domain, country, state or   province, city, name of the network provider, administrator and   technical support contact information. Each element is individually   parsed for easy integration into your applications, business   processes, and Web sites.

Flash 2D/3D Chart Generator
http://www.flash-db.com/services/ws/flashBarChart.wsdl
Highly configurable, dynamically created 2D and 3D animated Flash   Charts. Returns base64 encoded binary data (swf chart) to your Client.    This service allows you to specify a number of options in   your Client script, then the request is sent to this service where   the server creates the Flash Graph according to your input   parameters. A base64 binary data file is sent back to the client.   You can save this file (Highly suggested) or directly display it.      The Service use's the PHP Ming Library (don't worry you don't need   to have it installed) to dynamically create the SWF graph - and the   Nusoap/SOAPx4 web services toolkit to deploy it.  In this case I   just combined these two items into a distributable service.  I think   their is a lot of potential for services using the above mentioned   software, which is the main point of allowing public access to this   service - getting the idea's out their.    For a detailed description of how to use this service refer to:  http://www.flash-db.com/serviceHelp/flashCharts.php    Short list of input parts:  --------------------------  mainTitle, subTitle, xAxisTitle, yAxisTitle, sourceTitle (Strings -   should have obvious usage).    drawGrid, Animate, show3D - Has a value of 1 or 0.  For example   specify 1 for 'show3D' if you want a 3D chart, 0 for 2D.  1 for   Animation, 0 for no anmiation, etc.    dataArray - String of Values you wish to Graph. The dataArray is   formatted as: Apples:78.5,Oranges:34.8,Peaches:23.7, etc for   example. With the Name and Value seperated by a semi-colon, and each   pair seperated by a comma.  ---------------------    (I'll try to put up some sample code for using ASP.net to access   this service shortly).

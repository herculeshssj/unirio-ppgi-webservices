Get Countries (QueryBean)
http://www.tinetics.com/webservices/get_countries.cfc?wsdl
Returns a list of countries and the abbreviations in a QueryBean,   for use with JSP and CF. I have had many people try to use this in   ASP and PHP and did not work. Use the XML equiv if not using JSP or   CF. If you know how to get this to work in ASP, Please email me!

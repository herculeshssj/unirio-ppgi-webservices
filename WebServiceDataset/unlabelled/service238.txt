Search Validated UDDI registry
http://www.soapengine.com/lucin/salcentral/csearch.asmx?wsdl
Search for an entry within the UDDI registry using wild card and   multi-word search. The results are weighted depending on validity,   availability etc. This effectively means that working links that pass   validation and are deemed to be most complete i.e. a business with   contacts, services and discovery links is rated better than one   without and is more more likely to be seen at the top of all search   engine listings. This search offers unique abilities such as   searching across multiple types i.e. TMD, BUS and SRV and searching   on multiple keywords, ratings, periods etc. Works by returning UDDI   Key registry value or a link (linkURL) you can use to view the   original UDDI registry record. To get hold of the details of each   UDDI record using the UDDI Key you must use a UDDI SDK (for your   operating system) or the Inquire web service (the inquire web service   returns XML). This service can also serve value added information to   other UDDI search engines or companies who subscribe for data   mirroring, this means that other companies can use SalCentral's   validation processes and download the results when complete then use   them on their own systems, for more information please email   mirroring@lucin.com.    This web service has come about due to its ability to cure most data   inconsistancy problems within the UDDI public registry, in ongoing   tests 90% of the records we successfully retrieved were found to be   correct, valid and useful to the person searching, over the next few   months we will endeavour to improve on this percentage.

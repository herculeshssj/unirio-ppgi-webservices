Monthly Mortgage Payment
http://demo.eltegra.com/webservices/wsdl?app=MortgageCalculator
This EXADEL Web Services implementation can calculate a monthly   mortgage loan payment. In this simple case, the principal amount of   the loan, the length of the loan's term, and the interest rate are   required fields. Optional fields include the monthly property tax   rate and monthly homeowner's insurance premium payment. The  resultant number is the calculated monthly payment.

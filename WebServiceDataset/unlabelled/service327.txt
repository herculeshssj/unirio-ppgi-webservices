Xara NavBar Generator
http://ws.xara.com/navbar/navbar.wsdl
Xara NavBar Generator    Creates a 'mouse-over' graphical navigation bar for websites.    A SOAP Web Service that generates a button bar or navigation bar.   This is made from a number of separate PNG images for each button   that when placed next to each other form the complete NavBar. The   service returns 'off' and 'over' versions of the buttons and all the   required Javascript to make the Navbar react when the mouse moves   over the buttons.    This service is aimed at web authoring tools, e-commerce   applications, store or web site builders of any type that require   high quality, professional looking website navigation links, and for   these to be integrated with the stylistic design of the website. The   service could easily be integrated with online site builders or   integrated into online desktop apps.    The style of the Navbar is controlled by the selected template   design. Each design has a vertical or horizontal variation. You pass   a number of parameters including the style, the text to go on each   button, the link URLs, the colors required to customize the design to   match your website etc. The SOAP call should take about 2 to 4   seconds.    This service is based on the proprietary Xara vector rendering engine   that creates the graphics from a master vector design, anti-aliases,   color and palette optimizes the images for use (so the image files   are as small as possible). The buttons scale to accommodate the   required button text but also can scale in size with no loss of   quality.     This service is available for test purposes free-of-charge with a   limited number of design styles available. For commercial   applications please contact sales@xaraonline.com for more info.    You can find an online builder UI and hosted version of this service   from Xaraonline at http://www.xaraonline.com

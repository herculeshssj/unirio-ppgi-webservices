Euro Conversion
http://www.drbob42.co.uk/cgi-bin/Euro42/wsdl/IEuro
Converts Euros to the 12 Euro-participating currencies and back.  The European currencies that participate in the EURO are Finland = 'FIM', Italy = 'ITL', Netherlands = 'NLG', Spain = 'ESP', Belgium = 'BEF', Austria = 'ATS', Luxembourg = 'LUF', Germany = 'DEM', France = 'FRF', Ireland = 'IEP', Portugal = 'PTE', and Greece = 'GRO'. The three letter currency acronyms must be passed as argument to the FromEuro and ToEuro methods.

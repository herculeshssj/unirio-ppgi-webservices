This is an advanced email checker. You pass it an email address and   it does 3 checks for validity. The first check is the syntax of the   email address, then it checks the users domain name to see if an MX   record exists, it then connects to the mail server and tries to   verify that a mailbox exists. This does not work with all domains,   but most. You can see a demo at   http://www.tinetics.com/webservices/advancedemailcheck/  The interface is a little sloppy, but gives you the basic idea on   how it works.

Site Inspector
http://www.flash-db.com/services/ws/siteInspect.wsdl
The Site Inspector service checks a site for the type of server,   what the server is running, and the server time. Then returns the   results as an array. The original idea behind this was to obtain   server information such as Netcraft.com. At this time we do not keep   track of each request, in the future we may start tracking server   types and offer statistics based on usage.     To use the site inspector 3 parts are necessary (username, password,   and siteURL). The username and password part is so that we can   authenticate users in the future. At this time any username and   password can be used. siteURL is the URL of the site you wish to   inspect. The result is returned as a simple array with 3 parts   (serverTime, serverType, and Extra).

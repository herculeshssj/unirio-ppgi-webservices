Swedish Zipcode Info
http://www.marotz.se/scripts/zipinfo.exe/wsdl/ISwedishZipInfo
Maps Swedish address to zipcode.    Takes three inparameters: Street, Zipcode and City, and returns search result as a HTML table or an XML.    You can enter text in one, two or all of the inparameters, and the result will be generated of that information. Spelling of streetnames are sensitive to correct abbrevations, and I recommend not entering street numbers.

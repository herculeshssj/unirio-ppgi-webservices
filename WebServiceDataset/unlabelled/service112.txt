GlobalWeather (StationInfo)
http://live.capescience.com/wsdl/GlobalWeather.wsdl
GlobalWeather is a new and improved version of our popular   AirportWeather Web service. This Web service returns detailed, strong-  typed and time-stamped weather data, and returns results much faster   than AirportWeather. You can search for valid weather stations by   station codes, country, latitude, longitude, elevation, name or   region.

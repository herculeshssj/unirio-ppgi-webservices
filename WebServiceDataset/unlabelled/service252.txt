Amazon Query Service
http://majordojo.com/amazon_query/amazon_query.wsdl
Amazon has a REST based interface to their product catalog. For Amazon  Associates this is a god-send. However, there is no SOAP interface to  product catalog even though one can easily query Amazon for an XML  product listing.    This service is a SOAP gateway to that REST interface.

SOAP Data Dictionary
http://www.soapengine.com/lucin/salcentral/cdatadict.asmx?wsdl
This web service allows access to the data dictionary, a database   which scans EVERY web service within the UDDI registry looking for   similarities in naming conventions i.e. fields, method names,   namespaces etc. It then creates a unique database listing and allows   you to search across all these web services finding common naming   conventions i.e. the ability to locate every web service that   contains a field with the value 'User' in its description. This   allows the developer to conform to common naming conventions   therefore enabling tighter interoperability between web services at   this early state of the industry.

Using the weekly RDF Dumps from the Open Directory project, I've   created a WSDL Feeds for those people who do not have the time or   disk space to deal with the RDF dump. Now you can ask my server for   category information and get XML data back about that category,   related link, external links. Create your own ODP directory in just a   few short hours.

GoogleSearchAPI
http://api.google.com/GoogleSearch.wsdl
With the Google Web APIs service, software developers can query more <br>than 2 billion web documents directly from their own computer <br>programs. Google uses the SOAP and WSDL standards so a developer can <br>program in his or her favorite environment - such as Java, Perl, or <br>Visual Studio .NET.

This web service can be used by web service providers to bolt into the subscription base of salcentral. You simply use this authorise function every time your web service is run and by passing down to us a unique WSUID (identifies your service) which you obtain during registration we check your customers logon details against what they have subscribed against within salcentral. If they have purchased credits or registered to use your system we increase the number of calls they've used and programmatically return an OKO string to advise you they have subscribed to your service.
